### Description
The goal of the project is to prepare a piece of software that will take an RNA sequence as an input, run different secondary structure prediction algorithms, visualize the predictions using a few programs, and finally create a comparison of the methods' results. The user will then be able to see the diffrences in the methods' outputs and to choose the best fitting one.
